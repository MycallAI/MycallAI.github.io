    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Neon Night" - A dark mode theme with a deep navy background and vibrant, electric accents (cyan, magenta) to create a "flashy" and modern feel. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The structure is a single-column, long-form article, designed for a straightforward reading experience. The original blog post's sections are re-skinned with meme-culture titles to be more engaging ("The 'This is Fine' Strategy," "Big Brain Moves"). This linear flow, enhanced with flashy visuals and humor, is chosen to make a dense topic accessible and entertaining, guiding the user from problem to solution without distractions. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Core Content: Goal: Inform/Persuade. Method: The original blog post's text is rewritten with a humorous, meme-heavy tone. Justification: To make the strategic business advice more palatable and memorable for a modern audience.
        - Section Breaks: Goal: Organize. Method: Large, stylized emoji icons (ðŸ”¥, ðŸ§ , ðŸ‘‘) and bold, gradient text headers. Justification: Creates strong visual separation between sections and adds to the "flashy" aesthetic.
        - Key Points: Goal: Compare/Organize. Method: Styled "cards" with colored borders for the three main problems. Justification: Breaks up the text and visually reinforces that these are distinct, critical issues.
        - Call to Action: Goal: Persuade. Method: A "Change My Mind" style closing statement. Justification: A familiar meme format that acts as a confident, final argument.

                Alright, let's talk. You run a small IT firm here in Puerto Rico. You're grinding, you're hustling, you're the backbone for local businesses. You're basically the Bad Bunny of managed servicesâ€”versatile, essential, and everywhere. But while you're focused on the next client, you might be making a mistake thatâ€™s got your whole operation on the verge of a major L.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                We need to talk about your team. Specifically, the junior engineers youâ€™re *not* hiring. I get it, the logic is simple: clients pay for seniors, so you stack the deck with them. It feels like a pro gamer move. But in reality, you're creating a long-term crisis that's threatening to send your firm straight to the Gulag.

                    <p>
                        You've got your senior architectâ€”your MVPâ€”stuck doing basic ticket management and password resets. That's like asking Tego CalderÃ³n to just play the gÃ¼iro. It's a waste of talent. They should be designing systems and leading clients, not getting bogged down in low-level tasks perfect for a junior. This is how your best talent gets overworked, frustrated, and starts looking at your competitors. You're basically the distracted boyfriend meme: staring at "quick billable hours" while your "senior talent" looks on in horror.

                    <p>
                        Your team of all-stars is great, but they're all from the same era. A junior engineer is a direct pipeline to what's new *now*. They come in fresh from school, ready to experiment with the latest tools and ideas. Without them, your firm is the Steve Buscemi "How do you do, fellow kids?" meme. You're trying to be innovative with a tech stack from 2015, and it shows. This creates a hidden weakness that a more agile competitor will absolutely exploit.

                    <p>
                        Real talk: if you're not training juniors today, who's going to be your senior tomorrow? You're playing the IT version of the UNO "Draw 25" meme. The card says "Train a junior engineer" and you're out here picking up a whole deck of expensive, hard-to-find resumes from Indeed. You're outsourcing your own future and hoping you can buy it back later at a premium. That's not a strategy, that's a prayer.
