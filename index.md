As a SLUG graduate from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC)

![CYBERSLUG](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/cyber-slug.svg)

, I will apply allthe knowledge gained from my experiences and contacts in order to leave a
warm and lasting impression on the clientele. I would be right at home among
any IT staff or application developers. I have conducted research at UCSC and
Caltech through the Southern California Bioinformatics Institute and
MARC/MBRS programs. I also received professional training in presenting
scientific documents and reports.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.
>
> Temperance. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.
>Silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.
>Order. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.
>Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.
>Frugality. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.
>Industry. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.
>Sincerity. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.
>Justice. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.
>Moderation. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.
>Cleanliness. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.
>Tranquillity. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.
>Chastity. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.
>Humility. Imitate Jesus and Socrates.

*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
