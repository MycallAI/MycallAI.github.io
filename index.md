As a SLUG graduate from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC)

![CYBERSLUG](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/cyber-slug.svg)

, I will apply allthe knowledge gained from my experiences and contacts in order to leave a
warm and lasting impression on the clientele. I would be right at home among
any IT staff or application developers. I have conducted research at UCSC and
Caltech through the Southern California Bioinformatics Institute and
MARC/MBRS programs. I also received professional training in presenting
scientific documents and reports.
